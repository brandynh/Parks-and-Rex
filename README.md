>>>>  **Building MVC architecture with the MERN stack**  
>>>  - `Node.js` serves as the runtime environment wherein development is conducted, alongside Node Package Manager which streamlines and optimizes the use of project dependencies.  
>>>  - `Express.js` is implemented to manage request and response communication between front and back end.  
>>>  - `React.js` paints dynamic data onto the front-end, allowing our team to engineer a personalized and scalable user experience.  `React-bootstrap` allows for convenient templating of UI components. 
>>>  - `MongoDB` stores data modeled by `Mongoose`.  
>>>  - `Apollo` serves as a proxy, resolving front-end data requests through `graphQL` queries and mutations.  
>>>  - The `bcrypt` node package handles hashing and salting of user passphrases for fully authenticated account access, alongside the user context middleware offered by `Apollo`.  
>>>  - A service worker is implemented alongside `workbox` to cache data for potential application use in an offline network state.  
>>>  - Special thanks to [Dino Ipsum](https://dinoipsum.com/) API for data fetched using `axios`.  
>>>  - `Stripe` to be implemented in a future release to allow for digital purchases on the application.
